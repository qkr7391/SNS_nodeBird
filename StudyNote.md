# SNS

making SNS by using React, Next.js, node.js

---

## Day 1

- Basic setting (node/npm/next)
- pages
  - index.js: Home page
  - profile.js: Profile page
  - signup.js: Sign up page
- components [Next.js do not use React Router]
  - AppLayout.js: layout form
- eslint
  - Eslint is EcmaScript(JavaScript) + Lint (Mark for error code)
  - A tool that shows you when errors occur in your JavaScript syntax
- React Router
  - Routing is the ability to load different pages from different paths in a URL.
  - One of the oldest and most used routing-related libraries in React.
  - Set up a component-based routing system.
- Next.js
  - Framework for React projects (features to set up your React project)
  - Routing system, optimization, multilingual system support, server-side rendering, etc.
  - Routing system works based on file paths (React router alternative)

---

## Day 2

- Bundling: the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file, or "bundle".
  -> This bundle can be embedded in a web page to load the entire app at once.
  -> As the app grows, so does the bundle.
  (Especially if you include large third-party libraries, you want to avoid the problem of a large app causing long load times)
  ->To avoid getting stuck in a large bundle, it's a good idea to "code-split" your bundle.

- Code splitting: a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack and Browerify (factor-bundle) that allows you to create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
  -> Users can 'lazy-load' only what they need at the moment.
  -> Improve the performance of your app.
  -> Doesn't reduce the overall amount of code in the app, but avoids loading code that the user doesn't need.
  -> Users only get the code they need on the initial page load.

- import(): Dynamic Syntax
  -> The best way to introduce code splitting into your application

- Rendering: The process by which documents written by developers, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are output by the browser.

- Server-side rendering: how the server renders the page after pre-configuring everything that will be shown to the user.

-> The initial page that the user sees is rendered quickly
-> Stronger for search engine optimization (SEO) because it shows a screen rather than a blank page

- Client-side rendering: how to initially render the entire page (blank page) on the server and render it in the client (browser) whenever the user requests it.

-> Relatively fast to navigate from page to page since it is done within the browser
-> Fast because it only replaces the necessary content and data.
-> There is no difference between when the user sees it and when it is served to the user (TTV and TTI have a short gap)

## Day 3

- antd & style-component
- \_app.js & Head

Next has a webpack by default.

- Webpack: Webpack is a module bundler that merges and compresses many resources used by a web application into a single file.

- CSS files can't be imported, only JavaScript.
- When the webpack sees the CSS, it replaces the style tags and embeds them in the HTML, and it also processes and embeds images.

```JavaScript
import 'antd/dist/antd.css'
```

--> Webpack does the work for you because you imported it
But you need to do it to a common file for all your fetters. -> \_app.js

---

## Day 4

- \_app.js vs AppLayout.js
  > The parts that are common to all pages go into \_app.js, and the parts that are common to specific components go into AppLayout.js, which wraps around the individual components.

---

- Next provides a 'HEAD' component.

```JavaScript
import Head from 'next/head';
    <Head>
      <meta charSet="utf-8" />
      <title> NodeBird </title>
    </Head>
```

---

## Day 5

- CSS frameworks make heavy use of grid systems.

* Responsive: This is when a page is initially a mobile page, but as the screen increases in width, things like components are rearranged and changed to fit a tablet size, and when the screen increases further, it changes to fit a desktop size.

* Adaptive: Adaptive refers to developing separately for mobile, desktop, tablet, etc.

---

- 'antd' supports two components to make it responsive: horizontal and vertical lines.

```JavaScript
import { Menu, Input, Row, Col } from 'antd'
```

---

- Mobile Design: xs
- Tablet PC Design: sm
- Desktop Design: md(mini Desktop)
- lg/xl ...

```JavaScript
<Row>
    <Col xs={24} md={6} />
    <Col xs={24} md={12} />
    <Col xs={24} md={6} />
</Row>
```

ex. When I thought I was dividing a line into 24 parts,
1.1 xs={24} -> On a mobile screen, one column takes up the whole thing.
1.2 xs={12} -> on mobile screens,
one column takes up 12/24 of the line.

- gutter: In web design and layout systems, especially when using grid-based layouts or frameworks like Bootstrap or CSS Grid, the gutter refers to the space between columns or grid items. It's the horizontal and/or vertical spacing between elements within a layout grid. The gutter helps maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and readability between content elements.

---

## Day 6

- Login Form
  --> Using dummy data [state]

* useState: useState is a React Hook that allows functional components in React to manage state within themselves. It's a fundamental Hook used for maintaining and updating state in React functional components.

* When to Use useState: State Management: Use useState when you need to introduce state into a functional component. It helps keep track of values that might change over time.
  Component Re-rendering: It triggers re-renders of the component whenever the state value changes, updating the UI accordingly.
  Local State: useState is perfect for managing local component state, separate from global state managed by tools like Redux.

```JavaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false); //dummy data

{isLoggedIn ? <UserProfile /> : <LoginForm/>}
```

\*\*\* Assignment --> Change login form using library

---

## Day 7

1. Rerendering: Rerendering in React refers to the process of updating the DOM to reflect changes in your application's state or props. It's a fundamental part of React's component lifecycle. When state or props change, React will automatically trigger a rerender, updating the UI to reflect those changes.
2. Caching: Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed or computationally expensive data in a temporary storage area, known as a cache, to speed up subsequent access and retrieval.
3. Object Caching: Object caching refers to the process of storing frequently accessed or expensive-to-create objects in a cache, which allows faster retrieval and reuse of these objects rather than recreating them from scratch.
4. Functional Component:
   - Simple Functions Composing UI: React components that are written as functions instead of classes.
   - Stateless: Typically, they donâ€™t hold state and simply return UI based on the provided props.
   - Readability and Testability: They offer simplicity, high readability, and easier testing for components.
5. Hooks:
   - Functionalities for State and React Features in Functional Components: They enable state management and the use of React features in functional components, which was previously limited to class components.
   - useState, useEffect, etc.: Hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, and others provide functionalities for managing state, handling side effects, using context, managing reducers, and more.

[DO NOT SET OBJECT IN STYLE]

```JavaScript
<div style={{marginTop: 10}}>
```

> WHY? Each time the login form is re-rendered, a whole bunch of functions are executed, each time creating a new object, and since the objects are all unique, any comparison between them will result in a false positive, so it keeps re-rendering even though nothing has changed.

> WHAT SHOULD DO? Using 'styled-components' or 'useMemo'

- styled-components:

```JavaScript
import styled from 'styled-components';
const ButtonWrapper = styled.div`margin-top: 10px;`
        ...
<ButtonWrapper>
       ...
</ButtonWrapper>

```

- useMemo:

```JavaScript
import React, {useMemo} from 'react';
const style = useMemo (() => ({marginTop : 10}), []);
...
<ButtonWrapper style={style}>
  ...
</ButtonWrapper>
```

---

## Day 8

- Login with dummy data

```JavaScript
const LoginForm = ({setIsLoggedIn}) => {

const onSubmitForm = useCallback((e) => {
    console.log(id, password);
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
    },[id, password]);
}
return (
        <Form onFinish={onSubmitForm}>
        ...
```

- antd -> onFinish already has preventDefault() applied.

```JavaScript
const AppLayout = ({children}) =>{
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false); //dummy data
...
  <Row gutter={8}>
    <Col xs={24} md={6}>
      {isLoggedIn ? <UserProfile /> : <LoginForm setIsLoggedIn={setIsLoggedIn()}/>}
    </Col>
...
```

```JavaScript
const onSubmitForm = useCallback((e) => {
  console.log(id, password);
  setIsLoggedIn(true);
},[id, password]);
```

- AppLayout.js [setIsLoggedIn] pass to LoginForm as 'true'.
- Determine the value of isLoggedIn, and if logged in, go to the user profile, otherwise go to the login form.
- onSubmitForm gets the value of setIsLoggedIn from the login form and changes setLoggedIn to true when the login button is pressed.
- The new setLoggedIn value will be used to log in.

```JavaScript
 const onLogOut = useCallback(()=>{
  setIsLoggedIn(false);
},[]);
```

- Write onLogOut to work when the logout button is pressed in the user profile, replacing seInLoggedIn with false.

---

## Day 9

- Making Profile page: Building and optimizing a basic form [profile.js, NicknameEditForm.js, FollowList.js]

* Form Style

```JavaScript
const NicknameEditForm = () => {
	const style = useMemo(() => ({
		marginBottom: "20px",
		border: "1px solid #d9d9d9",
		padding: "20px",
	}));
	return (
		<Form style={style}>
			<Input.Search addonBefore="Nickname" enterButton="edit" />
		</Form>
	);
};
```

- List Style

```JavaScript
const FollowList = ({ header, data }) => {
	return (
		<List
			style={{ marginBotton: 20 }}
			grid={{ gutter: 4, xs: 2, md: 3 }}
			size="small"
			header={<div>{header}</div>}
			loadMore={
				<div style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: "10px 0" }}>
					<Button>more</Button>
				</div>
			}
			bordered
			dataSource={data}
			renderItem={(item) => (
				<List.Item style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
					<Card actions={[<StopOutlined key="stop" />]}>
						<Card.Meta description={item.nickname} />
					</Card>
				</List.Item>
			)}
		/>
	);
};

FollowList.propsTypes = {
	header: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
	data: PropTypes.array.isRequired,
};
```

---

## Day 10

- Making sing-up Page
- Using form

\*\* 'onFinish' event is often used in forms within React, particularly when working with form submissions or validations.

\*\* When use 'onFinish' event, don't need to use event.preventDefault() explicitly when handling form submissions because React handles form submissions differently by default, using its synthetic events

- Forms seen a lot in <Form>

```JavaScript
const [id, setId] = useState('');
const onChangeId = useCallback((e) => {
  setId(e.target.value);
},[]);
```

- Hooks can't be used inside loops, conditionals, or functions.
- They can be used inside components.
- Exception - Custom Hooks
  --> It's possible to create custom hooks to avoid getting stuck with code that repeats itself over and over again.
  [front - hooks - 'userinput.js']

```JavaScript
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";

export default (initialValue = null) => {
	const [value, setvalue] = useState(initialValue);
	const handler = useCallback((e) => {
		setValue(e.target.value);
	}, []);
	retur[value, handler];
};

```

- Using customized hooks can reduce duplicate code

```JavaScript
const [id, setId] = useState("");
const onChangeId = useCallback((e) => {
  setId(e.target.value);
}, []);
```

--->

```JavaScript
const [id, onChangeId] = useInput("");
```

- PasswordCheck, term is not follow same format, so need to make separate form for them.

```JavaScript
const [passwordCheck, setPasswordCheck] = useState("");
const [passwordError, setPasswordError] = useState(false);
const onChangePasswordCheck = useCallback(
  (e) => {
    setPasswordCheck(e.target.value);
    setPasswordError(e.target.value !== password);
  },
  [password]
);

const [term, setTerm] = useState("");
const [termError, setTermError] = useState(false);
const onChangeTerm = useCallback((e) => {
  setTerm(e.target.checked);
  setTermError(false);
}, []);
```

- onSubmit need to check the password and term

```JavaScript
const onSubmit = useCallback(() => {
  if (password !== passwordCheck) {
    return setPasswordError(true);
  }
  if (!term) {
    return setTermError(true);
  }
  console.log(id, nickname, password);
}, [password, passwordCheck, term]);
```

## Day 11

- Redux install

* store / configureStroe.js
* npm i next-redux-wrapper --> a library that integrates Redux with Next.js, simplifying the process of using Redux in Next.js applications

* const configureStore = () => {};: This line initializes a configureStore function. This function would typically hold your Redux store configuration logic, including creating the Redux store, applying middleware, combining reducers, and setting up the initial state.

* const wrapper = createWrapper(configureStore, { debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" });: Here, createWrapper is invoked with two arguments:

--> The first argument is configureStore, which is a function that will be responsible for creating the Redux store. Inside this function, you would configure your Redux store using libraries like redux, redux-thunk, etc.

--> The second argument is an options object. In this case, it includes a debug property that is set to true (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"). This enables debugging features in development mode, allowing for better inspection of the Redux store state, actions, and changes.

- The next-redux-wrapper simplifies the setup of Redux in a Next.js application by providing a mechanism to configure the Redux store and integrate it with the Next.js app. This configured wrapper can then be used within Next.js pages or components to access the Redux store using the provided context or server-side rendering features.

## Day 12

- Implementing redux in practice

Redux is one of the most effective libraries for state management in JavaScript apps.

Store:
A store is where you store the state of your application.
In Redux, an application must have one store.
Stores are created using the createStore function, which takes a reducer as an argument.

Action:
An action is an object that indicates what change in state is required.
Actions must have a type attribute, and other attributes contain additional information about the action.

Dispatch:
Dispatching means delivering the action to the store.
When you pass an action using the store's dispatch method, the reducer is called to update the state.

Reducer:
A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and the passed action and returns a new state.
The reducer determines how to update the state based on the type of action.
Multiple reducers can be combined to create a root reducer.

State:
State represents the current state of your application.
In Redux, state is managed immutably and is updated by reducers.

The basic behavior flow in Redux is as follows

1. A user fires an action.
2. The action is passed to the reducer via the store's dispatch.
3. The reducer generates and returns a new state based on the current state and the action.
4. The store is updated with the new state, and the UI is updated accordingly.


[reducers/index.js]

```javascript
// initialState setup
const initialState = {
    user:{
    isLoggedIn: false,
    user: null,
    signUpData: {},
    loginData:{},
    },
    post:{
        mainPost: [],
    }
}
```

```javascript
//action creator
export const loginAction = (data) => {
    return{
        type: 'LOG_IN',
        data,
    }
}

//action creator
export const logoutAction = () => {
    return{
        type: 'LOG_OUT',
    }
}
```
```javascript
// Reducer => it receives the previous state and action, returning a new state based on them
const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => { // Corrected the syntax
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'LOG_IN':
            return {
                ...state,
                user:{
                    ...state.user,
                    isLoggedIn: true,
                    user:action.data,
                }
            };
        case 'LOG_OUT':
            return {
                ...state,
                user:{
                    ...state.user,
                    isLoggedIn: false,
                    user:null,
                }
            };
        default:
            return state; // Return the default state if the action type doesn't match
    }
};
```

[LoginForm.js]
```javascript
const UserProfile = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const onLogOut = useCallback(()=>{
    // setIsLoggedIn(false);
    dispatch(logoutAction());
  },[]);
...
```

## Day 13

- Middleware and redux dev tools

'HYDRATE'

In the context of Redux, the term 'HYDRATE' is commonly associated with the Next.js framework and its integration with Redux. The 'HYDRATE' action is a convention used in Next.js to hydrate the client-side state with the server-side state during server-side rendering (SSR).

Here's how it typically works:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

During server-side rendering, the server fetches the initial data for a page and renders the HTML with that data. Next.js allows you to dispatch a special action called 'HYDRATE' as part of your Redux store state during server-side rendering.
Client-Side Hydration:

When the client receives the HTML from the server, including the 'HYDRATE' action in the Redux store state, Next.js on the client side uses this information to hydrate the client-side Redux store. This means it initializes the client-side state with the server-rendered state to avoid unnecessary data fetching and to maintain consistency between the server-rendered and client-rendered content.

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a way for web applications to generate the HTML for a page on the server and send it to the client during the initial load of the page. Traditional web applications use JavaScript on the client side to render pages dynamically, but SSR helps optimize performance by constructing pages on the server on initial load.

* Client-Side Rendering (CSR) works in the following flow:
When a user accesses a web page, a blank HTML page is loaded.
A JavaScript file is then downloaded and executed, which dynamically renders the page on the client side and displays it on the screen.

* SSR has the following flow: 
When a user accesses a web page, initial data is fetched from the server, and an HTML page is constructed and sent.
The HTML that reaches the client is rendered and displayed by the browser.
Later, when the client-side JavaScript is loaded, the page performs any additional required behavior.


* In Redux, we record history and can do a lot with it, so it's important to keep things "immutable".

## Day 14 

- Split reducer

```javascript
// Reducer => it receives the previous state and action, returning a new state based on them
const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => { // Corrected the syntax
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'LOG_IN':
            return {
                ...state,
                user:{
                    ...state.user,
                    isLoggedIn: true,
                    user:action.data,
                }
            };
        case 'LOG_OUT':
            return {
                ...state,
                user:{
                    ...state.user,
                    isLoggedIn: false,
                    user:null,
                }
            };
        default:
            return state; // Return the default state if the action type doesn't match
    }
};
```

* We're going to have a lot of different types, and we're going to have a lot of cases for each type, which is going to make the code in the reducer bigger and longer, so we need to break it up properly.

1. Create a user.js and post.js file inside your reducer folder. [each file is for the values in the state I currently have].

2. Split the code for each in index.js.

3. combine the split code using combineReducers.
```javascript
const rootReducer = combineReducers({ // Corrected the syntax
  user,
  post,
})
```
* Add Index Reducer for HYDRATE (for SSR)
```javascript
  index: (state = {}, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case HYDRATE:
        return { ...state, ...action.payload};

            // Return the default state if the action type doesn't match
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
```

** It's easy to keep code simple by distributing and breaking up longer pieces of code into roles, and it's easy to combine them using combineReducers.

--- 

## Day 15

- Posting form with dummy data

[reducers/post.js]
1. Make an initialState and some dummy data for post
```javascript
[initialState]
mainPosts: [
    id:1,
    User:{
        id:1,
        nickname:'dummy',
    },
    content: 'first post',
    Images: [{src:'image adress1'},{src:'image adress2'}],
    Comments: [{ User :{ nickname:'a1'}, content:'wow'},
                {User :{ nickname:'a2'}, content:'cool'},],
imagePaths: [],
postAdded: false,
```
```javascript
[dummyData]
const dummyPost = {
  id:2,
  content: 'dummy data',
  User: {
    id:1,
    nickname: 'dummydummy',
  },
  Images:[],
  Comments: []
}
```

2. make action creator
```javascript
//action creator
const ADD_POST = 'ADD_POST';
export const addPost = {
  type: ADD_POST,
}
```

3. Add new case for reducer
```javascript
[reducer]
case ADD_POST:
    return {
      ...state,
      mainPosts: [dummyPost, ...state.mainPosts],
      postAdded: true
    };
```

[pages/index.js]
Place components <PostForm> and <PostCard>
```javascript
const Home = () =>{
  const { isLoggedIn } = useSelector((state) => state.user);
  const { mainPosts } = useSelector((state) => state.post);
  //const mainPosts = userSelector((state) => state.post.mainPosts); ^same^

  return(
          <AppLayout>
            {isLoggedIn && <PostForm />}
            {mainPosts.map((post) => <PostCard key={post.id} post={post} />)}
          </AppLayout>

  );
}
```

[components/PostForm.js]
1. Create Basic <Form> with style what you designed
2. Add functions for each buttons and input box
```javascript
// Redux state and dispatch setup
const { imagePaths }= useSelector((state) => state.post);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// State and ref setup
const imageInput = useRef();
const [text, setText] = useState('');
const onChangeText = useCallback((e) => {
  setText(e.target.value);
}, []);

// Form submission handler
const onSubmit = useCallback(()=> {
  // Dispatching an action (addPost) with the current text state
  dispatch(addPost);
  // Resetting the text state
  setText('');
}, []);

// Image upload button click handler
const onClickImageUpload = useCallback(()=>{
  // Programmatically clicking the hidden file input to trigger file selection
  imageInput.current.click();
}, [imageInput.current])
```

## Day 16

* Redux Setup:
- **useSelector** is a hook from the react-redux library that allows you to extract data from the Redux store. In this case, it extracts imagePaths from the post slice of the Redux store.
- **useDispatch** is a hook from react-redux used to get access to the dispatch function.

* State and Ref Setup:
- **useState** is used to manage the state of the text input field.
- **useRef** is used to create a reference to the hidden file input.

* Form Submission Handler (onSubmit):
- **Dispatches** the addPost action with the current text state and resets the text state.

* Text Area for Post Text:
- An **input** area for entering the text of the post.

* Image Upload Section:
- Hidden file input (<input type="file" multiple style={{ display: 'none' }} ref={imageInput} />) for uploading images.
- **Image Upload** button (<Button onClick={onClickImageUpload}>Image Upload</Button>) that programmatically clicks the hidden file input when clicked.
- **Upload** button (<Button type="primary" style={{ float: 'right' }} htmlType="submit">Upload</Button>) to submit the form.

* Displaying Uploaded Images:
- **Maps** over the imagePaths array (images uploaded) and displays each image along with a "Remove" button (not yet implemented in your code).

## Day 17

### Post - Post Card

State Setup:
liked and commentFormOpened are state variables managed by the useState hook. They track whether the post is liked and whether the comment form is opened, respectively.

Toggle Functions:
onToggleLike and onToggleComment are callback functions that toggle the state of liked and commentFormOpened when the corresponding actions (like button click, comment button click) occur.

User ID Retrieval:
id is obtained from the Redux state using the useSelector hook. It represents the user's ID.

Card Component:
The Card component from the antd library is used to display the post. It includes post images, user avatar, nickname, and content.
The actions prop provides a set of action buttons (Retweet, Like, Comment, More).

Popover for More Options:
The Popover component from antd provides a menu with more options (Edit, Delete, Report) when the ellipsis icon is clicked.

Comment Form Visibility:
The comment form is displayed (<div>comment</div>) if commentFormOpened is true. This part can be replaced with the actual CommentForm component when implemented.

PropTypes:
PropTypes is used to define the expected shape of the post prop. It ensures that the prop is of the correct type and structure.

## Day 18

### Comments

[PostCard.js]
```JavaScript
{commentFormOpened &&
(<div>
  <CommentForm post={post}/>
  <List
          header={`${post.Comments.length} comments`}
          itemLayout="horizontal"
          dataSource={post.Comments}
          // Comment is for version 4.*
          renderItem={(item) => (
                  <List.Item>
                    {/*<li></li> -> <List.Item></List.Item>*/}
                    <List.Item.Meta //< Comment />-> <List.Item.Meta />
                            title={item.User.nickname} //author->title
                            avatar={<Avatar>{item.User.nickname[0]}</Avatar>}
                            description={item.content} //content->description
                    />
                  </List.Item>
          )}
  />
</div>)}
```

This code is a conditional rendering block written in JSX, and it renders a CommentForm and a list of comments only if commentFormOpened is true.

* breakdown:

1. {commentFormOpened && ...}: This is a conditional rendering statement. If commentFormOpened is true, the content inside the curly braces will be rendered; otherwise, nothing will be rendered.

2. <div>: Wraps the content to be conditionally rendered. It's a common practice to use a container element when you want to conditionally render multiple components.

3. <CommentForm post={post} />: Renders the CommentForm component and passes the post prop to it.

4. <List ...>: Renders an Ant Design List component to display comments.

  4.1. header={${post.Comments.length} comments}: Displays a header with the number of comments.
  4.2. itemLayout="horizontal": Specifies the layout of the list items.
  4.3. dataSource={post.Comments}: Sets the data source for the list to the Comments property of the post object.
  4.4. renderItem={(item) => ...}: Specifies how each item in the list should be rendered. In this case, it uses the List.Item and List.Item.Meta components to display information about each comment.
        4.4.1. title={item.User.nickname}: Displays the user's nickname as the title.
        4.4.2. avatar={<Avatar>{item.User.nickname[0]}</Avatar>}: Displays the user's nickname's first character as an avatar.
        4.4.3. description={item.content}: Displays the content of the comment.

5. </div>: Closes the container element.

So, the entire block of code conditionally renders a CommentForm and a list of comments when commentFormOpened is true

[CommentForm.js]
```javascript
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { Form, Input, Button } from 'antd';
import useInput from '../hooks/useinput';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
const CommentForm =({ post })=>{
    const id = useSelector((state) => state.user.self?.id);
    const [commentText, onChangeCommentText] = useInput("");
    const onSubmitComment = useCallback(()=>{
        console.log(post.id, commentText);
    }, [commentText])

    return(
        <Form onFinish={onSubmitComment}>
            <Form.Item style={{ position: 'relative'}}>
                <Input.TextArea value={commentText} onChange={onChangeCommentText} rows={4} />
                <Button style={{ position:'absolute', right: 0, bottom: -40 }}
                    type="primary" htmlType="submit"> Twit </Button>
            </Form.Item>
        </Form>
    )
}

CommentForm.propTypes = {
    post: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}
export default CommentForm;

```

* breakdown :

1. Functional Component Definition:
[ const CommentForm = ({ post }) => { ]
- CommentForm: Declares a functional React component named CommentForm.
- ({ post }): Destructures the post prop from the component's props.

2. Redux Selector:
[ const id = useSelector((state) => state.user.self?.id); ]
- Uses the useSelector hook to get the user's ID from the Redux store. The ?. is the optional chaining operator, ensuring that accessing self.id won't throw an error if self is undefined.

3. State Management with Custom Hook:
[ const [commentText, onChangeCommentText] = useInput(""); ]
- Uses the custom useInput hook to manage the state of the comment text. commentText holds the current value of the input, and onChangeCommentText is a memoized callback function to update that value.

4. Callback Function for Form Submission:
[ const onSubmitComment = useCallback(() => {
console.log(post.id, commentText);
}, [commentText]); ]
- Uses useCallback to memoize the onSubmitComment function. This function logs the post.id and commentText to the console when the form is submitted.

5. Form Component:
[ return (
<Form onFinish={onSubmitComment}>
{/* ... */}
</Form>
); ]
- Renders an Ant Design Form component. The onFinish prop is set to the onSubmitComment callback.

6. Form Item with TextArea and Button:
[ <Form.Item style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
<Input.TextArea value={commentText} onChange={onChangeCommentText} rows={4} />
<Button style={{ position: 'absolute', right: 0, bottom: -40 }} type="primary" htmlType="submit"> Twit </Button>
</Form.Item> ]
- Wraps the Input.TextArea and Button components within an Ant Design Form.Item.
Input.TextArea is a multi-line input field. Its value is controlled by commentText, and changes trigger the onChangeCommentText callback.
Button is a submit button with the label "Twit." It triggers the form submission.

7. PropTypes Validation:
[ CommentForm.propTypes = {
post: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}; ]
- Uses PropTypes to specify that the post prop must be an object and is required.

## Day 19

### Implementing Images

- Add the ability to show a single image, give the image a description via alt, and enlarge the image when clicked via the onClick event.
- The role of role="presentation" can be used to let screen readers know if they don't need to click on the image. (Since it's an event that enlarges the image, it can help screen readers filter out blind people because they have no reason to click on it).

``` javascript
if (images.length === 1) {
        return(
            <>
            <img role="presentation" src={images[0].src} alt={images[0].src} onClick={onZoom} />
            </>
        )
    }
```

```javascript
 if (images.length === 2) {
    return(
        <>
            <img role="presentation" style={{width: '50%', display: 'inline-block'}} src={images[0].src} alt={images[0].src} onClick={onZoom} />
            <img role="presentation" style={{width: '50%', display: 'inline-block'}} src={images[1].src} alt={images[1].src} onClick={onZoom} />
        </>
    )
}
return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
        <img
            role="presentation"
            style={{ width: '50%', display: 'inline-block' }}
            src={images[0].src}
            alt={images[0].src}
            onClick={onZoom}
        />
        <div
            role="presentation"
            style={{ display: 'inline-block', width: '50%', textAlign: 'center' }}
            onClick={onZoom}
        >
            <PlusOutlined />
            {/*<br />*/}
            {images.length - 1} more images
        </div>
    </div>
);

```

---

## Day 20 - Implementing an image carousel(react-slick)

1. make the image fullscreen when tapping more
image click -> execute onZoom() -> execute showImageZoom() 

[PostImages.js]
```javascript
const PostImages =({images})=>{
    const [showImagesZoom, setShowImagesZoom] = useState(false);
    const onZoom = useCallback(() => {
        setShowImagesZoom(true);
    },[]);

    const onCloce = useCallback(()=>{
        setShowImagesZoom(false);
    },[])

    if (images.length === 1) {
...
            {showImagesZoom && <ImagesZoom image={images} onClose={onClose} />}
...
    if (images.length === 2) {
...
        {showImagesZoom && <ImagesZoom image={images} onClose={onClose} />}
...
    return (
...
        {showImagesZoom && <ImagesZoom image={images} onClose={onClose} />}
...
```

2. components/imagesZoom/index.js 
WHY?
 Using directories and creating an index.js within them to organize components offers several advantages and disadvantages:
>> **Advantages:**
**Structure**: Grouping components into directories enhances the organization of files. This clarity in structure simplifies navigation and maintenance, especially as the project scales.
**Readability**: The directory structure improves code readability for developers. Each directory encapsulates related files, making it easier to understand the codebase's overall architecture.
**Maintainability**: Organizing components into directories facilitates maintenance tasks. With related files grouped together, modifications become more straightforward, enhancing the codebase's maintainability.
**Modularity**: Grouping components into directories promotes modularity. This enhances code reuse and allows for a more modular approach to managing the codebase.

>> **Disadvantages**:
**Additional Files and Folders**: Implementing directories introduces additional files and folders, potentially increasing the complexity of the project structure.
**Relative Path Usage**: Grouping components into directories necessitates using relative paths when importing components. This requires careful management of path configurations.
**Indirection**: Utilizing index.js to export components introduces indirection. While this aids organization, it can slightly reduce code readability due to the additional layer of abstraction.

>>> In summary, organizing components into directories and using index.js offers benefits in terms of structure, readability, maintainability, and modularity. However, it also introduces additional files, requires careful path management, and adds a layer of indirection to component imports. The suitability of this approach depends on the project's size, complexity, and the preferences of the development team.



3. npm i react-slick
>> react-slick is a popular React component library for building carousel/slider components. It provides a flexible and customizable way to create carousels or sliders with various features such as infinite looping, autoplay, lazy loading, responsive design, and more.
Here are some key features of react-slick:
**Responsive Design**: Carousels built with react-slick can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, making them suitable for use in responsive web design.
**Customization**: It offers a wide range of customization options for styling, navigation controls, animations, and behavior, allowing developers to tailor the carousel to fit their specific requirements.
**Accessibility**: react-slick aims to maintain accessibility standards by providing keyboard navigation support and ensuring that screen readers can interpret the carousel content correctly.
**Performance Optimization**: The library is designed to be efficient and performant, with features like lazy loading of images and optimized rendering for smooth user experience, even with large datasets.
**Rich Feature Set**: It supports various features commonly found in carousels, such as autoplay, infinite looping, draggable slides, multiple transition effects, and more.
Overall, react-slick simplifies the process of implementing a carousel/slider component in React applications, offering a robust and feature-rich solution for showcasing content in a visually engaging manner.

```javascript
<Slick
    initialSlide={0}
    afterChange={(slide) => setCurrentSlide(slide)}
    infinite
    arrows ={false}
    slidesToShow={1}
    slidesToScroll={1}
>
    {images.map((v)=> (
        <ImgWrapper key={v.src}>
            <img src={v.src} alt={v.src} />
        </ImgWrapper>
    ))}
</Slick>

```

4. CSS - styled component


** Slick problem occur

---

## Day 21 - Global styles and component directory structure

** Slick problem -> can not see the zoom images properly.
Slicks have a pre-determined class and styling. So you have to analyze the classes and styles and fix them one by one, but there is a way around that.


* Global styles : The style component is local scope. Also, Slick has its own CSS that declares a name for the class and gives it its own name, which makes it hard to make it work the way I want it to. With global scopes, I can just grab the parts I need without having to disassemble and analyze the structure piece by piece.
```javascript
import styled, {createGlobalStyle} from 'styled-components';

export const Global = createGlobalStyle`
 .slick-slide {
   display: inline-block;
 }
`
```

>> components/imagesZoom/index.js -> Structure
 components/imagesZoom/styles.js -> CSS

By keeping related files in a single directory, it's easier to manage longer code, and it's easier to modify because it's categorized by purpose.

---

## Day 22 - Hash Tag Link
* Linking to a hashtag so that clicking on it brings up related listings

https://regexr.com/ -> Regular expressions 
>> /(#[^\s#]+)/g  -> Regular epression for checking hashtag

```JavaScript
const PostCardContent = ({ postData }) => (
    <div>
        {postData.split(/(#[^\s#]+)/g).map ((v) => {
            if(v.match(/(#[^\s#]+)/)) {
                return <Link href={`/hashtag/${v.slice(1)}`}>{v}</Link>
            }

            return v;
        })}
    </div>
);
```

---

## Day 23 - redux-thunk

redux-thunk is a middleware for Redux, a popular state management library in React applications. It enables Redux to handle asynchronous actions by allowing action creators to return functions instead of plain objects.
In Redux, actions are typically plain JavaScript objects with a type property that describes the action and additional data if needed. However, in real-world applications, actions might need to perform asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from an API or interacting with a database. This is where redux-thunk comes in handy.

With redux-thunk, action creators can return functions instead of plain objects. These functions have access to the dispatch and getState methods of the Redux store, allowing them to dispatch multiple actions, perform asynchronous operations, and access the current state of the application.

```JavaScript
export const loginAction = (data) => {
    return (dispatch, getState) => {
        const state = getState();
        dispatch(loginRequestAction());
        axios.post('api/login')
            .then((res)=> {
                dispatch(loginSuccessAction(res.data));
            })
            .then((err)=>{
                dispatch(loginFailureAction(err));
            })
    }
}
```

--> You'll need to implement 'redux-thunk' on your own, except for the feature that allows you to do multiple dispatches at once. 

SO, 'saga' will be used for this project.

---
## Day 24 - install 'saga' and learning 'generator'

install 'saga' - [npm i redux-saga]

* 'redux-saga' : redux-saga is an alternative middleware for managing side effects in Redux applications. It leverages ES6 generator functions to handle asynchronous operations and side effects such as fetching data from an API, handling timeouts, and more, in a non-blocking manner.
1. Generator Functions: Generators are special functions in JavaScript denoted by an asterisk (*) after the function keyword. Within these generator functions, you can use the yield keyword to pause execution and return intermediate values.
2. Sagas: In redux-saga, sagas are generator functions that listen for specific Redux actions and perform side effects based on those actions. They are defined using the function* syntax and typically use a loop to continuously listen for actions.
3. Effect Creators: Inside sagas, you use effect creator functions provided by redux-saga to perform various side effects. These effect creators return plain JavaScript objects describing the side effect to be executed.
4. Middleware Integration: redux-saga middleware is added to your Redux store to intercept dispatched actions and run the sagas. The middleware then executes the sagas in the background, coordinating their execution with the Redux store.


[store/configureStore.js]
```javascript
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga';

import rootSaga from '../sagas';

const loggerMiddleware = ({dispatch, getState}) => (next) => (action) => {
    console.log(action);
    return next(action);
}

const configureStore = () => {
    const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()
    const middlewares = [sagaMiddleware,loggerMiddleware];
...
    store.sagaTask = sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);
...
};
```

[sagas/index.js]

```javascript
export default function* rootSaga(){
    
}

```

>> **generator** 
> basic generator form
![img.png](img.png)
> example 1 of generator
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
> example 2 of generator
![img_2.png](img_2.png)

1. generator stops at yield -> is a function with a breakpoint
2. the value after yield is returned as value.
3. You can use code that repeats infinitely, such as While(true), and run it as many times as you want.  -> When you want to express the concept of "infinity" in JavaScript, you can use generators.
4. You can use it like an event listener. (Calling next() when an event occurs and returning a value each time)

---

## Day 25 - 'saga' effect

```javascript
import { all, fork, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';

// like a event listener
function* watchLogIn(){
    yield take('LOG_IN_REQUEST', logIn);
    // take -> Wait for an action named 'LOG_IN' to be executed

}
// like a event listener
function* watchLogOut(){
    yield take('LOG_OUT_REQUEST');
    // take -> Wait for an action named 'LOG_OUT' to be executed
}
// like a event listener
function* watchAddPost(){
    yield take('ADD_POST_REQUEST');
    // take -> Wait for an action named 'ADD_POST' to be executed
}

export default function* rootSaga(){
 yield all([ 
     // all -> take array and run all arrays at the same time
     fork(watchLogIn),
     fork(watchLogOut),
     fork(watchAddPost),
     // fork -> run function
 ])
}
```

* fork vs call : In Redux-Saga, both call and fork are effects used to perform asynchronous operations, but they have different behaviors and use cases:

call Effect: [Synchronous function call -> wait for the request to return and put the result in result.]
call is used to call functions or methods that return promises or are asynchronous in nature.
When you use call, the Saga will pause until the called function resolves or completes.
call is blocking, meaning it will wait for the result before proceeding to the next instruction.
It's typically used for invoking pure functions, making API calls, or executing other Sagas.

fork Effect: [Asynchronous function call -> send a request and execute the next thing immediately, regardless of waiting for the result]
fork is used to spawn non-blocking tasks. It creates a new "forked" child Saga, allowing it to run independently in the background.
When you use fork, the Saga will not wait for the forked task to complete before moving on to the next instruction.
If the parent Saga is canceled, the forked task will also be canceled.
It's typically used for tasks that don't need to block the Saga, such as background tasks, concurrent data fetching, or handling parallel execution.


-> call is synchronous and blocks the Saga until the called function completes, while fork is asynchronous and creates independent tasks that run concurrently. Your choice between call and fork depends on whether you need the Saga to wait for the result of the operation or if you want it to proceed immediately without waiting.

```javascript
//call
function* logIn(){
    try{
        axios.post('/api.login')
            .then((result) => {
                yield put({
                    type: 'LOG_IN_SUCCESS',
                    data: result.data
                });
        }))
    } 
    ...
}

//fork
function* logIn(){
    try{
        axios.post('/api.login')
        yield put({
            type: 'LOG_IN_SUCCESS',
            data: result.data
        });
    } 
    ...
}
```


```javascript
// not geneerator
function logInAPI(data){
    // sent request to server
    return axios.post('/api.login', data)
}

// * -> generator
function* logIn(action){
    // Receive the results of sending a login request to the server
  const result =  yield call(logInAPI, action.data)
    // put -> dispatch (dispatch 'action')
    yield put({
        // action part
        type: 'LOG_IN_SUCCESS',
        data: result.data
    })
    
}

// * -> generator
function* watchLogIn(){
    yield take('LOG_IN_REQUEST', logIn);
}
```

* axios : Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. It provides an easy-to-use interface for performing asynchronous operations like fetching data from a server and handling responses. Axios supports features such as request and response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and error handling. It is commonly used in frontend and backend development for consuming APIs and interacting with web servers.

* redux-saga : Asynchronous Action Creators don't run directly, they act like event listeners.
ex) It runs a login generator function when an action named login comes in.

--- 

## Day 26 - 'take', 'take series', 'throttle'

* take : take effect is used to wait for a specific Redux action to be dispatched before continuing with the execution of the Saga. By default, take is a non-blocking effect, meaning it will not prevent the Saga from continuing to execute once the action it is waiting for has been dispatched. However, it will only match and capture the action once.

```javascript
import { all, fork, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';

// like a event listener
function* watchLogIn(){
    yield take('LOG_IN_REQUEST', logIn);
    // run only one time
}
// like a event listener
function* watchLogOut(){
    yield take('LOG_OUT_REQUEST');
    // run only one time
}
// like a event listener
function* watchAddPost(){
    yield take('ADD_POST_REQUEST');
    // run only one time
}
```


```javascript
function* watchLogIn(){
    while(true){
        yield take('LOG_IN_REQUEST', logIn);
    }
}

function* watchLogOut(){
    while(true){
        yield take('LOG_OUT_REQUEST', logOut);
    }
}

function* watchAddPost(){
    while(true){
        yield take('ADD_POST_REQUEST', addPost);
    }
}
```

or

```javascript
function* watchLogIn(){
    yield takeEvery('LOG_IN_REQUEST', logIn);
}

function* watchLogOut(){
    yield takeEvery('LOG_OUT_REQUEST', logOut);
}

function* watchAddPost(){
    yield takeEvery('ADD_POST_REQUEST', addPost);
}
```

* while take vs takeEvery : The difference is that while take works synchronously, while takeEvery works asynchronously.


```javascript
function* watchLogIn(){
    yield takeLatest('LOG_IN_REQUEST', logIn);
}

function* watchLogOut(){
    yield takeLatest('LOG_OUT_REQUEST', logOut);
}

function* watchAddPost(){
    yield takeLatest('ADD_POST_REQUEST', addPost);
}
```
* takeEvery vs takeLatest : takeEvery and takeLatest are both Redux-Saga effects used for handling asynchronous actions in response to dispatched Redux actions. They have different behaviors and use cases:

takeEvery:
takeEvery is a helper function that creates a new Saga every time the specified action type is dispatched.
It allows concurrent handling of multiple instances of the same action type. This means if multiple instances of the specified action are dispatched simultaneously, multiple Sagas will be spawned, each handling its own instance independently.
Useful for scenarios where you want to handle every occurrence of a particular action type, even if multiple instances of that action are dispatched concurrently.

takeLatest:
takeLatest is a helper function that creates a Saga to handle the most recent instance of the specified action type, canceling any previously forked Sagas for the same action type that are still running.
This means that if multiple instances of the specified action type are dispatched in quick succession, only the Saga corresponding to the most recent instance will be executed, and previous Sagas for the same action type will be canceled.
Useful for scenarios where you are only interested in handling the most recent occurrence of a particular action type, such as handling user input events where you only care about the latest input.

-> takeEvery is suitable when you want to handle every occurrence of a particular action type, while takeLatest is suitable when you only care about handling the most recent occurrence of a particular action type. The choice between them depends on your specific use case and requirements.

ex) When a click is made twice, a request is sent to the server twice, and a response is received twice. In this case, using takeLatest, the request cannot be canceled, but the response before the last response can be canceled.
However, since the request is not canceled, the data is requested to the server twice and stored in duplicate, so you need to add a procedure to check for duplicates in the backend.


```javascript
function* watchAddPost(){
    yield throttle('ADD_POST_REQUEST', addPost, 2000);
}
```

* throttle : throttle is a timeout effect that allows you to only accept one request for a limited amount of time. 

** Since we don't have a server at the moment, we'll utilize the 'delay' effect (which acts like a setTimeout) to give us an asynchronous effect.

* throttling vs debouncing : throttling and debouncing are two techniques used in web development, particularly in handling user input events like scrolling, resizing, typing, etc. They are used to improve performance and optimize the handling of these events, especially when they occur frequently. Here's a comparison:

Throttling: [scrolling]
Throttling ensures that the function is executed at a regular interval, preventing it from being called more than once in a given time period.
When an event occurs, the function will be executed at the start of the interval and then ignored until the interval has elapsed, even if the event continues to occur during that time.
It limits the rate at which the function is called.
Useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that a function is called at most once per specified interval, regardless of how many times the event occurs.
Example: If you're listening to scroll events and throttling the handler function, it would execute at a constant rate, say every 100 milliseconds, regardless of how frequently the scroll event is triggered.

Debouncing: [searching]
Debouncing delays the execution of the function until after a certain amount of time has passed since the last occurrence of the event.
When an event occurs, the function call is delayed by the specified time period. If the event occurs again within that time period, the previous call is canceled, and a new call is scheduled.
It ensures that the function is only executed after the event has stopped occurring for a certain duration.
Useful for scenarios where you want to wait until a user has stopped performing an action before taking action, such as searching after a user has stopped typing for a few milliseconds.
Example: If you're debouncing a search input field, the search function would only execute after the user has stopped typing for a specified duration, say 300 milliseconds. If the user continues typing, the execution of the search function is postponed until there's a pause in typing.

-> throttling limits the rate at which a function is called, while debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a pause in events. Both techniques are valuable for optimizing performance and managing event handling, depending on the specific requirements of your application.

* 'login' order
1. [LoginForm] -> try to login : input Id, Password and click the 'login' button
2. Run 'loginRequest Action'
3. [saga/user.js] execute 'LOG_IN_REQUEST' in function watchLogIn()
4. execute reducer switch case 'LOG_IN_REQUEST' in [reducer/user.js] && function* logIn in [saga/user.js]
5. 1sec later, 'LOG_IN_SUCCESS' -> dispatch, execute reducer switch case 'LOG_IN_SUCCESS' in [reducer/user.js]
6. 'self' got data -> 'isLoggedIn' will be true
7. changed to <UserProfile> from <LoginForm> in [AppLayout]

* Request -> reducer && saga -> 1sec later -> Success -> change <LoginForm> to <UserProfile>

--- 

## Day 28 - organizing action and state

[sagas/user.js], [sagas/post.js], [reducers/user.js], [reducers/post.js]

* To make your code more readable and maintainable, unify the names of code with similar properties and organize functions with repetitive structures.

* To avoid typos, we declare things as variables and give each item a similar organization to give it uniformity.

---

## Day 29 - Apply the changed state and perform an ESLINT check

1. change 'id' to 'email' -> because of MySQL error 
2. eslint change
```.eslintrc
"rules": {
    "jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control": "off",
    "jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid": "off",
    "no-console": "off",
    "no-underscore-dangle":"off",
    "react/forbid-prop-types": "off",
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": "off",
    "react/jsx-one-expression-per-line": "off",
    "object-curly-newline": "off",
    "linebreak-style": "off"
  }
```

## Day 30 - Post, Reply >> writing 'Saga'

1. when you post â€˜123â€™ and click upload button, addPost in â€˜PostForm.jsâ€™ get â€˜123â€™ to data and send data to success from addPost function in â€˜sagas/post.jsâ€™.
```javaScript
function* addPost(action){
    try{
        // const result =  yield call(addPostAPI, action.data)
        yield delay(1000);
        yield put({
            type: ADD_POST_SUCCESS,
            data: action.data
        });
```
And it goes to [ADD_POST_SUCCESS] in â€˜reducers/post.jsâ€™
```javascript
//function version of dummyPost
const dummyPost =(data) => ({
    id:2,
    content: data,
    User: {
        id:1,
        nickname: 'dummydummy',
    },
    Images:[],
    Comments: []
});

case ADD_POST_SUCCESS:
            return {
                ...state,
                mainPosts: [dummyPost(action.data), ...state.mainPosts],
                addPostLoading: false,
                addPostDone: true,
            };
```

>> Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `2`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
-> problem from 'dummyPost' 
```Javascript 
//function version of dummyPost
const dummyPost =(data) => ({
id:2,
...
``` 

* FIXING >> In dummyPost, we use the id value as the key, and since we fixed a specific value of '2', all posts will have the key '2', so we can't distinguish them in the loop.
Also, because of the nature of posts, the order of keys is constantly changing, so using keys as indexes is not a good idea.
In this case, we can use a method that generates randomized usernames.
-> use the 'shortid' library or the 'faker' library


```javascript
[redcers/post.js]
import shortId from 'shortid';

const dummyPost =(data) => ({
    id: shortId.generate(),
...
})
```

2. Wrting 'Comment' in comment form and click 'twit' button, then onSubmitComment in CommentForm.js will save it to data ()
[CommentForm.js]
```javascript
const onSubmitComment = useCallback(()=>{
    dispatch({
        type: ADD_COMMENT_REQUEST,
        data: { content: commentText, postId: post.id, userId: id},
    });
}, [commentText, id])
```

* receive post as a props, and receive id from reducer, receive comment from state and dispatch all of this and put those to â€˜ADD_COMMENT_REQUESTâ€™. 
* saga will receive that data to addComment function in â€™sagas/post.js'
```javaScript 
function* addComment(action){
    try{
        // const result =  yield call(addPostAPI, action.data)
        yield delay(1000);
        yield put({
            type: ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS,
            data: action.data,
        });
```

* sent data to ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS in â€˜reducers/post.jsâ€™
```javaScript
case ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS:
            //receive action.data.content, postId, userId
            return {
                ...state,
                addCommentLoading: false,
                addCommentDone: true,
            };
```

* Each time a post is added, it is appended to mainPost:[{...}] in front of it. To access the comments, you need to find them via the post ID, access the Comments within it, and add them with immutability.

```javascript
const dummyComment = (data) => ( {
    id: shortId.generate(),
    content: data,
    User: {
        id: 1,
        nickname: 'dummyComment',
    },
})
    ...
1)
case ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS:
    //receive action.data.content, postId, userId
    const postIndex = state.mainPosts.findIndex((v)=>v.id === action.data.postId);
    const post = state.mainPosts[postIndex];
    const Comments = [dummyComment(action.data.content), ...post.Comments];
    const mainPosts = [...state.mainPosts];
    mainPosts[postIndex] = { ...post, Comments };
   
    return {
        ...state,
        mainPosts,
        addCommentLoading: false,
        addCommentDone: true,
};

2)
case ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS:
    //receive action.data.content, postId, userId
    const postIndex = state.mainPosts.findIndex((v)=>v.id === action.data.postId);
    const post ={ ...state.mainPosts[postIndex] } ;
    post.Comments = [dummyComment(action.data.content), ...post.Comments];
    const mainPosts = [...state.mainPosts];
    mainPosts[postIndex] = post;
   
    return {
        ...state,
        mainPosts,
        addCommentLoading: false,
        addCommentDone: true,
};

```
-> The key to immutability is that only the things that change should be made new objects, and the rest of the objects should keep their references.
The code you've written is not clean, and it raises questions.

## Day 31 - Delete post with 'saga'


* Problem: Managing users and managing posts are separate in Reducer, so we need to solve the connection between them when publishing a post.
Ex) When you post a post, the post with your ID is uploaded to the post, and the post should be uploaded to the user's data. Conversely, when a post is deleted, the post with your username is deleted from the post, and the post should be deleted from the user's data.


[reducer/user.js & reducer/post.js]
```javascript
const dummyUser = (data) => ({
    ...data,
    Posts:[{id:1}, ...],
    ...
})
```
***Want to change the user reducer when adding/deleting posts.***


What if I want to change the user reducer status? -> The state can only be changed via an action.  -> Create an action.

```javascript
[reducer/user.js]
export const ADD_POST_TO_ME = 'ADD_POST_TO_ME';
export const DELETE_POST_OF_ME= 'DELETE_POST_OF_ME'
// ^^^ Create an action to change the state of the User reducer
```

```javascript
[saga/post.js]
function* addPost(action){
    ... (success)
        yield put({
            type: ADD_POST_TO_ME,
        })
    ...
```
Since saga can dispatch multiple actions at the same time, if an action needs to change multiple reducers at the same time, you can call the action multiple times 

```javascript
[reducer/user.js]
export const ADD_POST_TO_ME = 'ADD_POST_TO_ME';
export const DELETE_POST_OF_ME= 'DELETE_POST_OF_ME'

case ADD_POST_TO_ME:
    return{
        ...state,
        self:{
            ...state.self,
            Posts: [{id: action.data}, ...state.self.Posts],
        }
    };
case DELETE_POST_OF_ME:
    return{
        ...state,
        self:{
            ...state.self,
            Posts: state.self.Posts.filter((v) => v.id !== action.data ),
        }
    };
```

```javascript
[reducer/post.js]
case DELETE_POST_REQUEST:
    return{
        ...state,
        deletePostLoading: true,
        deletePostDone: false,
        deletePostError: null,
    };
case DELETE_POST_SUCCESS:
    return {
        ...state,
        mainPosts: state.mainPosts.filter((v) => v.id !== action.data),
        deletePostLoading: false,
        deletePostDone: true,
    };
case DELETE_POST_FAILURE:
    return{
        ...state,
        deletePostLoading: false,
        deletePostError: action.error
    };
```

```javascript
[saga/post.js]
function deletePostAPI(data){
    return axios.delete('/api/post', data)
}
function* deletePost(action){
    try{
        // const result =  yield call(addPostAPI, action.data)
        yield delay(1000);
        const id = shortId.generate();
        yield put({
            type: DELETE_POST_SUCCESS,
            data: action.data,
        });
        yield put({
            type: DELETE_POST_OF_ME,
            data: action.data,
        })
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
        yield put({
            type: DELETE_POST_FAILURE,
            data: err.response.data,
        });
    }
}
function* watchDeletePost(){
    yield takeLatest(DELETE_POST_REQUEST, deletePost);
}
```

## Day 32 - 'immer'

* What is 'immer'? 
-> Immer is a JavaScript library used for facilitating immutable updates to state in a more convenient and readable manner. It provides a simple API for creating copies of data structures with modifications, without mutating the original data. Immer uses a technique called structural sharing to optimize memory usage when creating these modified copies.
Immer is particularly popular in the context of React applications, where managing state immutably is crucial for predictable rendering and performance. It simplifies the process of updating nested state objects or arrays, making code more maintainable and less error-prone.

-> Invariants are important to keep, but they also make it easy to get bogged down in the slightest deviation, and code is only going to get longer and longer, so it's not easy to keep adding more and more code while maintaining invariants.
So let's utilize 'immer'.


```javascript
case ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS:{
    //receive action.data.content, postId, userId
    const postIndex = state.mainPosts.findIndex((v)=>v.id === action.data.postId);
    const post ={ ...state.mainPosts[postIndex] } ;
    post.Comments = [dummyComment(action.data.content), ...post.Comments];
    const mainPosts = [...state.mainPosts];
    mainPosts[postIndex] = post;
    return {
        ...state,
        mainPosts,
        addCommentLoading: false,
        addCommentDone: true,
    };
}

***Change***

case ADD_COMMENT_SUCCESS:{
    //Here, post is declared as a variable that will represent the post to which a comment is being added. It's assigned the result of the find method called on draft.mainPosts, which presumably is an array of posts. The find method is used to search for a post where the id matches action.data.postId.
    const post = draft.mainPosts.finc((v) => v.id === action.data.postId);
    
    //This line adds a new comment to the Comments array of the post found in the previous step. It uses the unshift method to add the new comment to the beginning of the array, effectively making it the newest comment.
    post.Comments.unshift(dummyComment(action.data.content));
    
    //These lines update the state properties addCommentLoading and addCommentDone to reflect the status of adding the comment. Setting addCommentLoading to false indicates that the process of adding a comment has finished (either successfully or unsuccessfully), while setting addCommentDone to true indicates that the action of adding a comment has been completed successfully.
    draft.addCommentLoading = false;
    draft.addCommentDone = true;
    
    break;
    };
}
```

```javascript
[reducer/user.js]

case ADD_POST_TO_ME:
    return{
        ...state,
        self:{
            ...state.self,
            Posts: [{id: action.data}, ...state.self.Posts],
        }
    };
case DELETE_POST_OF_ME:
    return{
        ...state,
        self:{
            ...state.self,
            Posts: state.self.Posts.filter((v) => v.id !== action.data ),
        }
    };

***Change***

case ADD_POST_TO_ME:
    draft.self.Posts.unshift({id: action.data});
    break;
case DELETE_POST_OF_ME:
    draft.self.Posts = draft.self.Posts.filter((v) => v.id !== action.data )
    break;
```

## Day 33 - 'faker'

* What is 'faker'?
-> faker is a JavaScript library used for generating fake data in various formats and types. It is commonly used in development and testing environments to simulate realistic data for applications without needing to use real data sources.
With faker, you can generate fake data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, lorem ipsum text, and much more. This can be particularly useful for testing purposes, including unit testing, integration testing, and UI testing, as well as for populating demo or sample data in applications during development.

```javascript
[reducer/post.js]
initialState.mainPosts = initialState.mainPosts.concat(
    Array(20).fill().map((_, index) => ({
        id: shortId.generate(),
        User: {
            id: shortId.generate(),
            nickname: faker.internet.userName()
        },
        content: faker.lorem.paragraph(),
        Images: [],
        Comments: [{
            id: shortId.generate(),
            User: {
                id: shortId.generate(),
                nickname: faker.internet.userName()
            },
            content: faker.lorem.sentence(),
        }],
    })),
);

## Day 34 - Infinite scrolling


* Call an action called loadPostRequest in pages/index.js that loads the dummy data
```javascript
[reducers/post.js]
export const initialState = {
    mainPosts: [{
        id: 1,
        User: {
            id:1,
            nickname: 'sammy'
        },
        content: 'first post #hashtag #yeah',
        Images:[{
            id: shortId.generate(),
            src:'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1705002455875-29da8631d626?q=80&w=2187&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D'

        },
        ],
        Comments: [{
            id: shortId.generate(),
            User:{
                id: shortId.generate(),
                nickname: 'a1',
            },
            content: 'wow',
        },
            {
                id: shortId.generate(),
                User:{
                    id: shortId.generate(),
                    nickname: 'a2',
                },
                content: 'cool',
            }]
    }],
    imagePaths:[],
    addPostLoading: false,
    addPostDone: false,
    addPostError: null,
    deletePostLoading: false,
    deletePostDone: false,
    deletePostError: null,
    addCommentLoading: false,
    addCommentDone: false,
    addCommentError: null,
}
```

```javascript
export const initialState = {
    mainPosts: [],
    imagePaths:[],
    addPostLoading: false,
    addPostDone: false,
    addPostError: null,
    deletePostLoading: false,
    deletePostDone: false,
    deletePostError: null,
    addCommentLoading: false,
    addCommentDone: false,
    addCommentError: null,
}
```
***Implementing infinite scrolling with SAGA***

Clear the contents of the dummy data and make a request from the server to fetch the data
1. Clear the dummy data contents
2. make that part a function -> Replace the part that fetches from the server with the following
```javascript
export const generateDummyPost = (number) => Array(20).fill().map((_, index) => ({
    id: shortId.generate(),
    User: {
        id: shortId.generate(),
        nickname: faker.internet.userName()
    },
    content: faker.lorem.paragraph(),
    Images: [],
    Comments: [{
        id: shortId.generate(),
        User: {
            id: shortId.generate(),
            nickname: faker.internet.userName()
        },
        content: faker.lorem.sentence(),
    }],
}))

initialState.mainPosts = initialState.mainPosts.concat(generateDummyPost(10));
```
3. Make the LoadForestRequest call immediately on first screen load from pages/index.js
```javascript
[pages/index.js]
const Home = () =>{
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    useEffect(() => {
        dispatch({
            type: LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST,
        });
    }, [])
```
Make a set of loadposts [LOAD_POSTS_xxx, loadPostsxxx ...] in reducers/posts.js and sagas/post.js

4. Make it request and show new loading when scrolling reaches a certain point

```javascript
[pages/index.js]

const dispatch = useDispatch();
// const { isLoggedIn } = useSelector((state) => state.user);
const { self } = useSelector((state) => state.user);
const { hasMorePosts, mainPosts, loadPostsLoading } = useSelector((state) => state.post);
//const mainPosts = userSelector((state) => state.post.mainPosts); ^same^


useEffect(() => {
    dispatch({
        type: LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST,
    });
}, []);

useEffect(()=> {
    function onScroll(){
        console.log(window.scrollY, document.documentElement.clientHeight, document.documentElement.scrollHeight);
        if(window.scrollY + document.documentElement.clientHeight > document.documentElement.scrollHeight - 300){
            if (hasMorePosts && !loadPostsLoading) {
                dispatch({
                    type: LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST,
                });
            }
        }}
    window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);

    return()=>{
        //If you don't return and clear it, it will continue to accumulate in memory.
        window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
    };
}, [hasMorePosts, loadPostsLoading])

```

* What is 'react-virtualize' ?
React Virtualize is a library for efficiently rendering large lists and tabular data in React applications. It helps to improve performance by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen, thus reducing the memory footprint and improving the perceived performance of the application.

* A virtualized list is a technique used to efficiently render large lists of data in web applications by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen. This approach helps to optimize performance and reduce memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Here's how a virtualized list works:

- Dynamic Rendering: Instead of rendering all the items in the list at once, a virtualized list dynamically renders only the items that are currently visible within the viewport of the browser.

- Windowing: The virtualized list maintains a "window" or a subset of the total list items that are currently in view. As the user scrolls through the list, the content within this window updates dynamically to show the relevant items.

- Item Recycling: As items scroll out of view, they are removed from the DOM (Document Object Model) to conserve memory. Conversely, as new items scroll into view, they are dynamically added to the DOM. This process is often called "item recycling" or "window shifting."

- Fixed-Size Containers: The virtualized list typically uses fixed-size containers for list items, which ensures consistent rendering performance regardless of the total number of items in the list.

- Optimized Rendering: By rendering only the visible items, the virtualized list optimizes rendering performance and reduces the load on the browser, resulting in smoother scrolling and improved user experience, especially for large datasets.

Popular libraries like React Virtualized, react-window, and react-infinite-scroll-component provide components and utilities to implement virtualized lists efficiently in React applications. These libraries offer various customization options and optimizations to suit different use cases and performance requirements.

In summary, virtualized lists are a powerful technique for efficiently handling large datasets in web applications, ensuring smooth performance and a seamless user experience, even with extensive lists of data.

## Day 35 - Implement 'Following' and 'Followers'

```javascript
[PostCard.js]
<Card
    ...
extra={<FollowButton post={post} />}
>

```

```javascript
[FollowButton.js]
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'antd';
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const FollowButton = ({ post }) => {
    return <Button>Follow</Button>
}

FollowButton.propTypes ={
    post: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}

export default FollowButton;
```

-> Make Follow Button on each Cards.

* Show the Follow button only when logged in
```javascript
[PostCard.js]
<Card
...
extra={id && <FollowButton post={post} />}
```

* When you press the Follow button, 
1. the Following number will increase
2. the Follow button changes to an Unfollow button.

## Day 36 - Running a server with node

```javascript
[back/app.js] - basic form
const http = require('http');

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log(req.url, req.method);
    res.end('Hello Node');
});

// Start listening for incoming connections on port 3060
server.listen(3065, () => {
    console.log('Server is listening on port 3065');
});

```

```javascript
[back/app.js]
const http = require('http');

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log(req.url, req.method);
    if(req.method === 'GET'){
        if(req.url === 'api/posts'){
            
        }
    } else if(req.method === 'POST'){
        if(req.url === 'api/posts'){

        }
    } else if(req.method === 'DELETE'){
        if(req.url === 'api/posts'){

        }
    }
    ...
    
    res.write('<h1>HELLO NODE1</h1>');
    res.write('HELLO NODE2');
    res.write('HELLO NODE3');
    res.write('HELLO NODE4');
    res.end('Hello Node');
});

// Start listening for incoming connections on port 3060
server.listen(3065, () => {
    console.log('Server is listening on port 3065');
});

```

* Continuing to use conditional statements like this will make our code longer and more complex, so we'll use express.
